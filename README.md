## Contributing
You are very welcome to contribute to this project. Create an issue for whatever feature or bug you would like to work on (or pick an existing issue), fork the repo, do your work and eventually create a pull request. If you would like to work on a larger improvement it makes sense to first discuss the feature here on GitHub.

## Webservice
The app relies on the webservice documented at https://ws.fh-joanneum.at/manage/documentation.php. There you can also get a key which you need to enter in the `at.fhj.app.util.Config` class. If you want to contribute to the webservice you can also do so on GitHub: https://github.com/moopat/fhpi-server

## Ancient History
For previous versions and changes please refer to Google Code (https://code.google.com/p/fh2go/). Any further development will be done on GitHub.
